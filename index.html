        <div class="subheading mb-5">Business AdministrationðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">I was born and raised in Los Angeles, CA. Growing up, I always had an instinct for business. I created my own business in high school in which I recycled clothes I did not wear anymore by reselling them for a cheaper price. Later when I was going off to college, I was influenced by my family to pursue my interests. I took this as initiative to pursue Business. I knew once coming in that I would need experience to get into the workforce however, I came into undergrad with no job or connections. To progress myself as a student and as a professional, during my first two quarters as a freshman, I had a bit of spare time and used that time to my advantage to look into programs offered by my school, the area and remotely. I eventually got hired by a marketing and sales company called VectorMarketing. My job at VectorMarketing was completely remote based. We would meet through Zoom and have group sessions to motivate each other and do group sales calls. Through Vector, I learned how it is important and even beneficial to be supported so publicly. It taught me the importance of teamwork and how a little bit of confidence can go a long way. Despite my time at VectorMarketing being short-lived, I found solace in the new settings I had been exposed to during my time there.<br><br>

        After Vector, I started a remote internship with a Software Company, HiDevMobile. HiDevMobile, a Software and Hardware Development Design Company, greeted me with welcoming arms. The company, located in San Mateo, Bay Area was a completely remote position as I am in Southern California. My position was working as a Business Development intern. I enjoyed my time at HiDev greatly, because of how much it exposed me to the inside process starting a business project till the very end of the publishing moments. I was at HiDevMobile for about 3/4th of a year and I am thankful for the experience because life is all about creating experiences for yourself. This internship really set up a concrete path for myself and taught me what it was I was good at and what I am interested in.<br><br>

        These experiences I have made so far during my college experience are momentary parts of my life that keep me driven. They are also the reason why I am choosing to concentrate in Information Systems. I realized that even though I liked the front-end of business, working with people, giving presentations, I am also extremely interested in the technolgical side of things. During my time as an intern, I was able to see how both of these roles come together to create business and how crucial it is to have people that can understand and execute on both ends. As I continue my time in undergrad, I hope to land more roles that allow me to pursure both of my interests. I plan landing roles that can mold me to become the best professional and personal version of myself.
